A story written with Git

-The prompt:
At the age of 16 everyone gets teleported into a small room. In front of you is a table with all kinds of meals from apples to gourmet meats. 
Whatever you take a bite of will determine what superpower you'll get. You are the first person to take a bite of the table itself.

-The response:
That probably wasn't the greatest idea. There's a plethora of amazing, tasty choices in front of you... and you chose the hardest possible... option? Does the table even count? Wood isn't exactly edible, but you didn't think that part over yet. It's going to suck being you in a few hours, but hopefully you'll have some cool powers by then to make up for it. There's no way anyone else was dumb enough to try this before.
